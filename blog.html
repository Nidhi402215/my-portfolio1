      <h2>How I Built My First Website üöÄüêç</h2>
      <p class="blog-date">June 28, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Creating my first website was an exciting and valuable learning experience. I 
        started by planning the structure of the website, deciding that I wanted it to be
        a personal portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and background. Once I had 
        a basic idea of what I wanted, I began writing the HTML code to build the 
        foundation. This included creating different sections like the homepage, about 
        me, projects, and contact information. I used simple HTML tags to add headings, 
        paragraphs, images, and links.
      </p>
      <p>After building the structure, I moved on to styling the website using CSS. I 
        chose a clean and modern design, picking suitable fonts, colors, and layouts. 
        I experimented with different styles and made use of CSS features like flexbox 
        and grid to align elements properly and create a responsive layout that would 
        look good on both desktops and mobile devices.
      </p>
      <p>To add some interactivity, I used JavaScript. For example, I included some simple animations to 
        make the website feel more dynamic. I also learned how to center images, align 
        text, and make my website visually appealing.
     </p>
     <p>Throughout the process, I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor and tested 
        the website using the Live Server extension, which helped me see the changes 
        instantly. It was a journey of learning through trial and error, but it gave me 
        a solid understanding of how websites are built from scratch. Seeing my website 
        live on the browser for the first time was truly rewarding, and it motivated me 
        to keep learning and improving my web development skills.

      <h2>Why I Love Python üêç</h2>
      <p class="blog-date">July 5, 2025</p>
      <p>
       Python has always been my favorite programming language because it is simple, 
       readable, and powerful. When I first started learning to code, Python helped me 
       grasp programming concepts without feeling overwhelmed by complex syntax. The 
       code feels natural, almost like writing in English. This makes it perfect not just 
       for beginners, but also for professionals who want to create clean, maintainable 
       applications.</p>

      <p>One of the things I admire most about Python is its versatility. Whether I‚Äôm 
        working on web development, automating repetitive tasks, analyzing data, or 
        experimenting with artificial intelligence, Python has the right tools and 
        libraries to help me get the job done. Frameworks like Flask and Django make 
        backend development smooth, while libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib 
        are excellent for handling data and visualizing insights.</p>

      <p>I also value the large community around Python. Whenever I‚Äôm stuck, I can find 
        help through documentation, tutorials, or discussion forums. This strong 
        community support has been very motivating and has helped me grow as a developer.</p>
       
      <p> Overall, Python is more than just a tool for me; it is the language that 
        sparked my interest in programming and continues to empower me to build 
        real-world projects and learn something new every day. It is fast, flexible, 
        and truly enjoyable to work with, which is why I will always love Python.
